TfL London Underground Mapping Program
==============

The purpose of this application was to allow for a graphical way for me to state which station was at which co-ordinate in the map image provided. It creates a list of co-ordinates with the three letter station code at the beginning and the X and Y co-ordinates relative to the image top left.
